# Challenge-01

## Description
For this project I needed to change the code to meet accessiblity standards. We also removed redundant code from our style sheet. 


## Why
I wanted the codebase to follow aceessiblity standards because we want our site to be optimized for search engines.

## What did I learn 
I learned about the different semantic elements and in which order to use them in. These are the semantic elements I learned about nav, aside, and figure. I also learned that you don't us main more then one time. 

Here is a screen shot of me using the nav element: ![alt screen shot of using nav](assets/images/Screenshot%202023-03-05%20152233.png)

## Screen shots of redundant code we removed from css. 
This is what our style sheet looked like before:
